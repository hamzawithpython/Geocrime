          Crime locations and attributes may be aggregated from publicly available records (e.g., police incident data) and/or curated datasets.
          Availability varies by place and time. Records can be incomplete, delayed, reclassified, or removed by their publishers. As a result,
          displayed maps, counts, and labels may not reflect the full set of incidents for any area or time period.
